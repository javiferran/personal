I am a final year PhD student at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), supervised by [Marta R. Costa-jussà](https://costa-jussa.com/). Currently, I am also a [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/) scholar, mentored by [Neel Nanda](https://www.neelnanda.io/about). During my PhD I have been fortunate enough to do research internships at [AI at Meta (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/), in the Machine Translation team at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), and in the Books Science team at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/). Before starting my PhD, I completed a MsC Data Science also at UPC, during which I worked part-time at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/).

My research focuses on interpretability and analysis of models. Currently, I am doing mechanistic interpretability research in Large Language Models, with special interest in improving their safety. Apart from research, I have also been a teacher assistant at several courses in the Computer Science and Telecommunications departments at UPC.
